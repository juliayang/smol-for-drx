    "## 2. Initialize semi-grand canonical information \n",
    "\n",
    "High-level description: In running a topotactic delithiation, we need to specify the kinds of semi-grand canonical swaps expected. In this case, a single swap proposal is the removal of Li+ and oxidation of Mn, or a Li+ insertion and reduction of Mn. Specifying these swaps is done with `GC_flip_table`. We also would like Li+ to disorder across multiple sublattices, but only Li+, which is why we cannot just indicate `allow_crossover=True` since that would mobilize the Mn2+ (across tetrahedral and octahedral shared sublattices). Therefore, we must specify a more specific swap, which is the shared sublattice swap with Li+ and Vacancy, and we do that clearly in `shared_table`. Technically `allow_crossover` is still `True` which is why it's kept as input. In the example below, we do SGC swaps for 50% of the proposals, and shared Li/Vacancy canonical swaps for the other 50%.\n",

    "2. Li+ + Mn3+ <-(>) Vac + Mn4+ \n",

    "Currently as implemented, if you specify Vacancy, you must specify this as `str(Vac)`. This is converted into a smol Vacancy (DummySpecie) later by the function `make_shared_swap_table`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initialize relative chemical potentials: \n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to initiate the chemical potentials for all the species. Note that it's always the relative chemical potential that matters in a SGC calculation, so these can be set arbitrarily. Just be cognizant of what you are enforcing when you scan in different chemical potentials. If you aren't seeing anything happen, you may need to scan in a different chemical potential range, or change the reference chemical potentials. "

We enforce 50% of the swaps to be SGC steps in `GC_flip_table` and the other 50% to be canonical Li/Vacancy shared swaps. The parameter `combine_domains` is only for SGC flips and generally `False` so that picking of one site within a swap occurs within the same sublattice. You will generally want to keep this to `False`. (The reason it is still a parameter is that the concept of `combine_domains` is necessary in Mn disportionation reactions to satisfy detailed balance. Furthermore, maybe in some systems, one would want to perform SGC swaps across all possible cation sublattices.)\n",
